        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <h2>Q: Does Origin Snow offer sponsorships?</h2>
        <p>A: Technically, we do. However, we are a <a href="http://www.originsnow.com/about-us/">small independent company</a> and cannot afford to give a free board to every little ripper we see.</p>
        <p>Sponsoring kids can be tricky, as there is a chance that their interests will change, and we want to make sure that their decisions are not swayed by material objects.</p>
        <p>Even the most loyal riders will eventually move on to another brand as they outgrow our boards, so we want to make sure the partnerships we make are mutually beneficial for the time we work together.</p>
        <p>We consider these requests very much on a case-by-case basis, and it is usually as much about the family as it is the young rider.</p>
        <h2>Q: What size board should I get for my kid?</h2>
        <p>A: We’ve made it super easy to figure out which board is the right size for your kid! Check out our <a href="http://www.originsnow.com/snowboards/">Snowboards</a> / <a href="http://www.originsnow.com/discounts-and-closeouts/">Discount Snowboards</a> pages and find the right size based on your child’s height and weight.</p>
        <p>However, if you’d like a more tailored response, please <a href="mailto:info@originsnow.com">contact us</a> and we’d be happy to give you a hand.</p>
        <h2>Q: What age range does Origin make snowboards for?</h2>
        <p>A: Age isn’t really the best gauge when determining the correct snowboard size. Height and weight are really much better to use for this.</p>
        <p>We currently manufacture boards for kids between 36 and 58 inches tall or 24 and 95 lbs.</p>
        <p>Also, you can see the minimum and maximum height for each size in the board specs on our <a href="http://www.originsnow.com/snowboards/">Snowboards</a> page. Or, <a href="mailto:info@originsnow.com">contact us</a> and we’d be happy to help you figure it out.</p>
        <h2>Q: What is the youngest age I can start my child on a snowboard?</h2>
        <p>A: As with determining the best size board for your child, age is not really the best gauge. Origin makes boards for kids as small as 36 inches (91 cm) in height. However, child strength, balance, athletic ability and over-all interest varies from kid to kid. We do suggest renting a time or two before purchasing if you’re not certain your kid will love it.</p>
        <p>A few of our retailers do offer rentals on Origin Snowboards. Check them out on our Dealers page. If your favorite retailer doesn’t carry Origin Snowboards, go tell them they should!</p>
        <h2>Q: Is it true that it is better to start my kid on skis before putting him / her on a snowboard?</h2>
        <p>A: No. This used to be the case as it was difficult to find gear small enough to suit your little one. We’ve seen kids as young as 18 months snowboarding (although that isn’t common). The only other consideration is kid strength.</p>
        <h2>Q: Is it true that resorts do not offer lessons to kids under 6?</h2>
        <p>A: This used to be true, but mainly for group lessons. Many resorts offer (and have offered) private lessons for kids under 6. And many are starting to offer group lessons at younger ages as well.</p>
        <h2>Q: Should I teach my child myself or get him / her lessons?</h2>
        <p>A: We here at Origin Snow are huge proponents of parents teaching their kids to ride. It is a tremendous bonding experience that little else can compare to.</p>
        <p>Of course, if you yourself do not ride (or don’t have the patience to teach; it’s OK… we won’t judge!) lessons are a great alternative.</p>
        <p>We also see the value of lessons after the child knows the basics to hone specific skills and / or just to get another perspective. Kids don’t always have the same teachers at school, so having additional input can be very helpful.</p>
        <p>Kids also learn a GREAT deal from one another. If you have the ability to have your kids ride with other children, do it!</p>
        <h2>Q: What are some pointers on teaching my son or daughter to ride?</h2>
        <p>A: Origin doesn’t profess to be the authority on snowboard instruction. However, here are a few tips we’ve found to be helpful in our experiences:</p>
        <p>1) Keep the knees bent. This does not mean sit down. Nor does it mean bend at the hips. Keep the knees slightly bent to absorb terrain / keep the body fluid. It also keeps the feet from washing out beneath the rider.</p>
        <p>2) Keep weight on the leading foot. This is a little bit of a mind game. Of course, it’s not 100% necessary (or practical) to lean on your lead foot all the time, but what this tip does is keep the kid mindful about keeping the base of the board on the snow. It can be counterintuitive (and scary, for some) to want to lean down the mountain. But if the base of the board isn’t on the snow, then control is greatly compromised. Yes, of course we eventually want them tail-pressing off of everything, but for now, keep it on the snow!</p>
        <p>3) Lock the shoulders / Hands in “pocket position.” The tendency is to wave the arms wildly. This doesn’t help. You want to turn the shoulders, not the arms, in the direction you want to go. The rest of the body will follow the shoulders’ lead. Keeping the hands down “in the pocket position” (or, on / where the pockets would be on the front of the pants) helps by keeping the arms from flailing and “locks the shoulders” into position.</p>
        <p>4) LOOK where you want to go. A common tendency is to look down at the feet / board / snow. Looking ahead to where you want to end up will help steer subconsciously.</p>
        <p>5) . . . and most importantly KEEP IT FUN. If it isn’t fun, kids won’t do it. Of course eventually you’d like your kid to go Pro to pay for that big house in the hills for all those weekend getaways, but not yet. If they love it, they’ll want to do it more often. And the more they do it, the better they will get. Patience is the key.</p>
        <h2>Q: Is my kid regular or goofy-footed (or which foot should be the leading foot)?</h2>
        <p>A: First of all, let’s define both.</p>
        <p>Regular-footed means the left foot will be the lead (front) foot. Goofy-footed means the right foot will be the lead (front) foot. Don’t ask us why the right foot is considered “goofy.” Luck of the draw, perhaps.</p>
        <p>While there is no sure-fire, guaranteed way to figure this out, there are a few things that can be used as indicators:</p>
        <p>1) Has your child ever ridden a skateboard, scooter or surfboard? If so, it’s likely that they will use the same leading foot employed for these activities for snowboarding. (However, this is not the case 100% of the time. We have at least one kid out the Snow Squad that skates one way and snowboards the other.)</p>
        <p>2) Slide across a slick / polished surface in socks. If they slide with their left foot in front, they are probably regular-footed. If they slide with their right foot in front, they are probably goofy-footed.</p>
        <p>3) This one *can* be dangerous, so just be gentle about it. Have your kid stand in front of you facing away from you. With no warning (and as little force as necessary), give your kid a little push and pay attention to which foot they step forward with first. If they step with their left foot first, they are probably regular-footed. If they step with their right foot first, they are probably goofy-footed.</p>
        <p>Some people say that the lead foot can be determined by which is the dominant hand, but we’ve seen little-to-no correlation between the two.</p>
        <h2>Q: Will you be adding any more sizes / styles to your product line?</h2>
        <p>A: Yes. We are constantly in R&amp;D. We’re currently working on all sorts of cool new stuff. Follow us on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/OriginSnow" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/OriginSnow" target="_blank">Twitter</a> for updates. Further, if you have any suggestions, we’d love to <a href="mailto:info@originsnow.com">hear from you</a>!</p>
        <h2>Q: Does Origin Snow make snowboards for adults?</h2>
        <p>A: No, we do not. And we don’t plan on it.</p>
        <p>Unlike other brands that try everything to all people and lose focus of their core principles, we are dedicated to designing and manufacturing the best snowboards and equipment for kids possible. And that’s all we’re going to do.</p>
